## What is a shell?

System program that allows a user to execute:
- shell functions (internal commands)
- other programs (external commands)
- executable shell scripts

Linux/UNIX have a bunch of shells, the most common are:
- sh, csh, - shells from the Unix era but still in use
- tcsh - an expanded version of csh (Bill Joy, Berkley, Sun)
- **Bash** - (the Free Software Foundation (FSF) **B**ourne **A**gain **Sh**ell) one of the most popular and rich in functionaility shells - default shell for Linux
- ksh - korn shell
- zhs - an enhanced bash shell
- Many others

MobaXterm terminal runs bash for its command line interface

## Shell Commands

Format: command name and 0 or more arguments
- Ex: `% commandname [arg1] ... [argN]`

Arguments can be:
- Options - switches to the command to indicate a mode of operation
    - usually prefixed with a hyphen (-) or two (--) in GNU style
- Non-options or operands - the data to work with
    - Ex: actual data, a file name, etc.

The *shell* is a "power-user" interface... the user interactis with the shell by typing in commands
- the shell interprets the commands that may produce some results (returned to the user) and (generally) the controll is given back to the user when the command completes
- "Internal" commands are directly interpreted and executed by the shell
- “External” commands are programs that may call functions of
the OS kernel
- Kernel functions are often encapsulated in so-called system
calls that ask the kernel to perform an operation (usually
privileged) on your behalf.

## Command I/o
Input to the shell:
- Command name and arguments typed by the user

Input to a command:
- keyboard, file, or other commands

The "files" `stdin` and `stdout` are often together referred to as a terminal
- standard input (`stdin`): keyboard by default
- standard output (`stdout`): display by default

Both `stdin` and `stdout` can be redirected from/to a file or other command
- `<` - input
- `>` - output
- `>>` - output append

## stdin, stdout, stderr
Every process (program) has three default open file descriptors
- `stdin` - data input
- `stdout` data output
- `stderr` - error messages

By default, they are connected to the keyboard and display by the shel when the process is created
- `% cat` - reads stdin, writes stdout
    - Ex:
- `% sort%` - reads stdin, writes stdout

Program can open a file (perhaps specified on command line) instead
- `% cat file` - reads file, writes stdout
- `% sort -o ofile ifile` - reads ifile, writes ofile
    - Ex: `gcc -Wall -std=c99 -o roy.exe roy.c linehelper.c`

But the shell can do this instead, saving every program from having code to read command line for filenames, but also permitting some very usful, flexible behavior.
Program is stil just reading tdin, writing stdout, stderr

Its the shell that's opening the files and connecting them to the file descriptors!
- `% cat > file` - reads stdin, writes file
- `% sort < ifile > ofile, reads ifile, writes ofile

## Redirection  
`command > file` - sends stdout 
`command >> file` - send stdout to file, appending to existing contents
`command > file 2> errors` send stdout to file, stderr to errors
`command &>file` - send stdout and stderror to file
command < file read stdin from file
command < file > output read stdin from file send stdout to output
command << XXX use following lines as stdin, until line with only XXX

## Pipes
What is a pipe?
- is a method of interprocess communication (IPC)
- represented as '|' in shell
- int means that the outpput of one program (on one side of a pipe) serves as an input for the program on another end.
- a set of "piped"


Ex: `ls -l /home/royk/*.c | sort`
- `-l` gets the long format
- `*` is "any" (wild card)
