text input/output is dealt with as streams of characters no matter the source.

a text stream is a sequence of characters divided into lines 
each line consists of zero or more characters followed by a newline ('\n')
some OS's, including windows, terminate a line with "\r\n" but normally we don't have to worry about that because it's handled by the library

several functions for reading and writing a single character at a time but two of the simplest are:
- `getchar()` - gets next character from console and returns it. Returns `EOF` if there are no more characters
- `putchar()` - writes 

Calls to putchar() and getchar() can be interleaved; output appears in the order in which calls are made

**Two versions of file copy:**
Version 1
```C
/**
* filecopy.c - copies characters one at a time from/to the console
* Copies characters one at a time from the console input stream
* (typically keyboard) to the console output stream (typically
* the display)
*/
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int c;
    c = getchar();
    while (c != EOF) {
        putchar(c);
        c = getchar();
    }
    return 0;
}

```

Version 2

```C
/**
* filecopy.c - copies characters one at a time from/to the console
* Copies characters one at a time from the console input stream
* (typically keyboard) to the console output stream (typically
* the display)
*/
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int c;
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        putchar(c);
    }
}
```

**Getting word count from file**

```C
/*
Keeps a running total of the number of characters, word, and lines in ...
*/
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdbool>

int main() {
    int c;
    uint32_t nl = 0, nw = 0, nc = 0;
    bool in_word = false;
    while((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        // got a new character - increment character count
        // count will include all characters, including '\n'
        ++nc;

        if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t') {
            // yep at the end of the word
            in_word = false;
        } else if (!in_word) {
            // we weren't in a word but we are now because we got a character
            // that didn't indicate end of a line
            in_word = true;
            ++nw
        }
    }
    printf("Num lines: %d\tNum words: %d\tNum characters: %d\n", nl, nw, nc);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Arrays
The elements are stored in contiguous locations in memory (in order)
You can use the sizeof() operator to determine the size of the memory block occupied by the array (in bytes)
- Ex: char buffer[1024] -> sizeof(char) * 1024 = 1024 bytes

**Fixed length arrays:**
Format: `type name[number_of_elements]`
Ex: `char buffer[4 * 512]` 

**Dynamic arrays:**
Can use malloc() and free() to reserve storage for an array


**Accessing the elements of an array:**
The array elements are addressed by using a subscript (also called an index)
- Ex: `char buffer[100]; char el8 = buffer[8];`

**Initializing an array:**
If the array is automatic (local to a function) its elements have undefined values and should be initialized.
if the array is global or static (defined outside a function) its elements have the value of 0.
The elements of an array can be initlized when defined by using an initialization list (ex: int a[4] = {1, 2, 4, 8}).

You can omit the length of an array definition if you supply an initialization list.

If the array is defined with both a length and specification and an initialization list the length of the array is specified by the expressions between [] and all elements that are not initialized are set to 0 (or NULL for pointers)
- Ex: `int a[4] = {1, 2} //same as {1, 2, 0, 0}`

Array initializers must have the same type as the array.

Count number of occurrence of digits, white spaces, or other characters
```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int ndigit[10];
    int c, i, nwhite, nother;

    // initialize the occurrence counts to 0
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        ndigit[i] = 0;
    }
    // classify the character in the input stream
    while ((c = getchar()) != EOF) {
        if (c >= '0' && c <= '9') 
            ++ndigit[c-'0'];
        else if (c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t')
            ++nwhite;
        else
            ++nother;
    }
    // display the results
    printf("digits= ");
    for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
        printf("ndigit[%d]:%d ", i, ndigit[i]);
    printf("\nwhite space = %d, other = %d\n", nwhite, nother);
}
```

**Prototyping Helper Functions:**

```C
/****************** Function Prototypes ***********************/
int power(int base, int n);

/****************** Helper functions ***********************/
/**
* power() - raise base to the n-th power. n > = 0;
*
* @param base number to raise to n-th power
* @param n-th power to raise the number to
*
* @return an int containing base**n
*/
int power(int base, int n) {
    int i, p;
    p = 1;
    for (i = 1; i <= n; ++i)
        p = p * base;
    return p;
}
```
