# Make:
Basic Make file
```Make
# needs tabs to space not spaces

# target
main: main.o scale.o
    # linker command
    gcc -o main.o scale.o
scale.o: scale.c scale.h
    gcc -c scale.o

```

More advanced Make file
```Make
# variable, adds the -g tag when used with gcc commands
gcc_sw = -g

# Targets
main: main.o scale.o
    # linker command
    gcc -o main.o scale.o

main.o: main.c
    gcc $(gcc_sw) -c main.o
scale.o: scale.c scale.h
    gcc $(gcc_sw) -c scale.o

clean: 
    rm main mina.o scale.o

install: main
    cp main /tmp/Mainprogram
```

Automatic variables

example make file:
```make
eval.o : eval.c eval.h
    g++ -c eval.c
```
```make
$@ - The name of the target of the rule (eval.o)
$< - The name of the first dependency (eval.c)
$^ - The names of all the dependencies (eval.c eval.h)
$? - The names of all dependencies that are newer than the
target
```


Make file for RPN calculator
```make
rpn_calculator: stackADT.o SLLinkedList.o rpn_calculator.o
    gcc -Wall -std=c99 -o rpn_calculator.exe *o

rpn_calculator.o: rpn_calculator.c rpn_calculator.h SLLinkedList.h stackADT.h lineHelpers.h rpn_calculator.c

stackADT.o: SLLinkedList.o stackADT.c stackAdt.h
    gcc -Wall -std=c99 -c stackADT.c

SLLinkedList.o: SLLinkedList.c SLLinkedList.h
    gcc -Wall -std=99 -c SLLinkedList.c

lineHelpers.o: lineHelps.c lineHelpers.h
    gcc -Wall -std=c99 -c lineHelpers.c

clean:
    rm *.o *.exe
```

# Binary Trees

Terminology:
- Root node − The node at the top of the tree. There
is only one root per tree and one path from the
root node to any node
- Leaf node − A node with no children
- Subtree − Subtree represents the descendants of a
node
- Ancestor/Descendent - A node p is an ancestor of
node q if there exists a path from root to q and p
appears on the path. The node q is a descendant of
p
- Siblings − Children of the same parent
- Path − The sequence of nodes along the edges of a
tree
- Key − The value of a node based on which a search
operation is to be carried out
- Visiting a node − Visiting refers to checking the
value of a node when control is on the node
- Traversing the tree (subtree)− The operation of
passing through all of the nodes in a tree in a
specific order

Types of Binary Trees:
- Strict binary tree – a tree where all of the nodes have either 0 or 2
children
- full binary tree – a tree where all nodes have exactly two children and
all of the leaf nodes are at the same level
- Complete binary tree – a tree where all leaf nodes are at level h or h – 1
and there are not any missing nodes


Types of Binary Tree Traversal
- In-order Traversal (Results in a sorted List): Until all nodes have been visited
    - 1: recursively traverse the left sub-tree
    - 2: visit the root node
    - 3: Recursively traverse the right sub-tree
- Pre-order Traversal: Until all of the nodes have been visited
    - 1: visit the root node
    - 2: recursively traverse the left sub-tree
    - 3: Traverse the right sub-tree
- Post-order Traversal: untill all the nodes have been visited
    - 1: recursively traverse the left sub-tree
    - 2: recursively traverse the right sub-tree
    - 3: visit the root node
