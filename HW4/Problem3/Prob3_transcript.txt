The application appears to be working correctly from the printed transcript. 
I used a very similar process for generating random values as the example in HW3. 
This utilized the functions that were built into the iom module and returned what was expected. 
I repeated this process untl I got eight samples, one for every "3 hours" and logged them into their own
arrays and using a sorted insert helper function. When reading the array values in order the values only increase
with each subsequent index.
When averaging the values by hand I also received the same results as the application 
so I assume it also does that part correctly too. 

When runnin the application multiple times it continues to produce reliably sorted results.
