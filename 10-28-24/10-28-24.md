# Dynamic Storage Allocation
dynamic storage allocation isused most often for strings, arrays and structures.
- dynamically allocated structures can be linekd together to form lusts, trees, and other data structures

Dynamic storage allocation is done by calling a memory allocation function (declared in <stdlib.h>):
- malloc() - allocates a block of memory but doesn't initialize it.
- calloc() - allocates a block of memory and clears it
- realloc() - resizes a previously allocated block of memory
- these functions return a value of type void * ("generic pointer")

If a memory allocation function can't locate a memory block of the requested size, it returns a NULL pointer
```C
if ((p = malloc(1000)) == NULL) {
    // allocation failed; take appropriate action
}
```

# Deallocating Dynamic Memory
a block of memory that's no longer acessible to a program is said to be garbage.
- a program that leaves garbage behind has memory leak

Collecting the garbage
- some languages (like java) provide a garbage collector that automatically locates and recycles garbage
- C doesn't, each C program is responsible for recycling its own garbage

Callling free() releases the block of memory that p points to
- void free(void *ptr);

Beware of dangling pointers!
- free(p) deallocates the memory block that `p` points to, but doesn't change `p` itself.
- if we forget that `p` no longer poitns to a valid memory block it may cause a problem when attempting to acces or modify the memory that p points to.

# The -> Operator
Accessing a member of a structure using a pointer is so common that C provides a special operator for this purpose.
- this operator, known as the right arrow selection, is a minus sign followed by a >.

Using the -> operator, we can write `new_node->value = 10;` instead of `(*new_node).value = 10;`

THe -> operator produces an lvalue, so we can use it like a normal variable


# Dynamic memory allocation in C
Functions:
- malloc() - to allocate from the heap
- free() - to deallocate from teh heap

`void *malloc(size_t size)` allocates a memory cell from the heap large enough to hold a value fo the tpe that is on its right hand side
