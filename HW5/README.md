# Overview
The binary search tree implemented in this repository is a completely original implementation developed by Jeremiah Vandagrift. It was not made using reference to other implementations of a binary tree. It uses a mix of recursive and iterative approaches to search, navigate, and insert nodes into the tree.

When using the populateBST function, the tree provides reading date for that day and the following 29 days. The function autmatically inserts these days in an order that will result in a balanced tree.

The binary tree struct is implemented as so that it can support multiple instances and a class like interface, hence implementing many of the utility functions as static functions that the binary tree struct contains pointers too.
