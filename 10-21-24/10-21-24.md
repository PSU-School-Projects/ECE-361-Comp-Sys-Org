## Linux File System

**Linux/Unix file security**
Each file has owner, group, and other (everybody else)

permissions set by owner
- Read, write, execute
- owner, group other,
represented by vector of four octal values

Only owner or root can change permissions
- this privilege cannot be delegated or shared

**Internal Commands**
- ls, see man ls or (ls -help) for details
    - % ls
        - all files except those starting with a `.`
    - % ls -a
        - all files
    - % ls -A
        - all files except those starting with a `.` and `..`
    - % ls -F
        - append `/` to dirst and `*` to executables 
    - `% ls -l`
        - long format
    - `% ls -al`
        - include hidden files and show long format?
    - `% ls -lt`
        - sort by modification time (latest - earliest)
    - `% ls -ltr`
        - reverse

- `% cat`, Will read from STDIN and print to STDOT every line you enter.
    - `% cat file1 [file2] ...`  Will concatenate all files in one and print them to STDOUT
    - `cat > filename`, Will take whatever you type from STDIN and will put it into the file filename
    - To exit `cat` or `cat > filename` type Ctrl+D to indicate EOF (End of File)

- More - pager to display content
    - Pagers to display contents of large files page by page or
scroll line by line up and down.
    - Have a lot of viewing options and search capability.
    - Interactive. To exit: ‘q

- Less, (enhanced more)
    - to display contents of a file: `% less filename`
    - To display line numbers:
    - `% less -N filename` 
    - To display a prompt: ` % less -P"Press 'q'` to quit filename
    - Combine the two: `% less -NP"Blah-blah-blah" filename`
    - For more information: `% man less`

- `rmdir`, removes directory
    - `% rmdir dirname`
    - Equivalent: `% rm -r dirname`

- ln - create a symbolic link (a "shortcut")
    - Ex: `% ln –s <real-name> <fake-name>`

- `find`, looks up file in a directory tree
    - `% find . -name name`
    - `% find . \(-name ‘w*’ -or -name ‘W*’ \)`

- `grep`, searches its input for a pattern
    - The pattern can be a simple substring or a compex regular expression
    - if a line matches, it's directed to STDOUT; otherwise, it's discarded
    - `% echo "blah-foo" | grep blah`
        - will print the matching line
    - `% echo “blah-foo” | grep zee`
        - will not print as there is no match

- `history`, displays recent commands
    - % history
        - all commands in the history
    - `% history 10`
        - last 10
    - `% history -r 10`
        - reverse order
    - `% !!`
        - repeat last command
    - `% !n`
        - repeat command n in the history
    - `% !-1`
        - repeat last command, same as `% !!`
    - `% !-2`
        - repeat second to last command
    - `% !ca`
        - repeat last command that begins with "ca"


**Compiling C programs with GCC**
Default behavior of gcc is to produce an executable program file (.exe in windows) from source code
- ex: `$ gcc -Wall circle.c` invokes the compiler system on a C source file called "circle.c". -Wall tells GCC to display warnings if it finds any.
- no errors, runs and exits "silently". Produces a file named a.out (or a.exe in windows) which can be run from the command prompt `$ ./a.out`

Can specify the output filename in the command by using the -o option
- `$ gc -Wall -o circle circle.c`
    - `$ ./circle.out` to run

Options:
    - to compile `-c`
    - specify output filename: `-o <filename>`
    - include debugging symbols: `-g`
    - gbd (GNU debugging) friendly output: `-ggdb`
    - Show all (most) warnnings: `-Wall`
    - optimizations: `-O`, `-O*`
